# bis-observer

A portable, self-hosted observability stack built on the Grafana LGTM ecosystem.
Collects metrics and logs from any Docker-capable node and aggregates them into
a single Grafana instance.

## Architecture

```
[ collector node ]          [ collector node ]          [ collector node ]
  node-exporter               node-exporter               node-exporter
  cadvisor                    cadvisor                    cadvisor
  alloy ─────────────────────── alloy ─────────────────── alloy
         remote_write / loki push          │
                    │                      │
                    ▼                      ▼
              [ aggregator node ]
                prometheus  ← receives all metrics
                loki        ← receives all logs
                grafana     ← visualization
                + collector (self-monitoring)
```

Collectors are stateless and identical across all nodes — bare metal, VM,
Raspberry Pi, whatever runs Docker. The aggregator is the only node that
needs to be reachable by all collectors.

Two ingestion paths feed the aggregator. Full collectors **push** (remote_write
for metrics, push for logs) as drawn above. Nodes that can't run Alloy (armv7,
IoT) and Kubernetes clusters are **pulled** by Prometheus from `file_sd` target
lists in `aggregator/targets/` (provisioned per-aggregator by Ansible). See the
k3s section for cluster monitoring.

## Stack

| Component    | Role                                              | Port (default) |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| node-exporter| Host metrics: CPU, RAM, disk, network             | 9100           |
| cAdvisor     | Container metrics                                 | 8080 (lo only) |
| Alloy        | Unified collector: scrapes + ships metrics + logs | 12345          |
| Prometheus   | Metrics store, remote write receiver              | 9090           |
| Loki         | Log store, push receiver                          | 3100           |
| Grafana      | Visualization                                     | 3000           |
| kube-state-metrics | Kubernetes cluster object state (k8s clusters only) | 8080 → NodePort |

Alloy replaces both Promtail and prometheus-agent in a single container.
Promtail reached end-of-life March 2026. kube-state-metrics is pulled by the
aggregator that owns a cluster — see the k3s section.

## Quick Start

### Any collector node

```bash
cd collector
cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env          # set AGGREGATOR_HOST to the aggregator's IP
make collector
```

### Aggregator node

```bash
cp aggregator/.env.example aggregator/.env
cp collector/.env.example collector/.env

$EDITOR aggregator/.env   # set ports if needed (defaults are fine)
$EDITOR collector/.env    # set AGGREGATOR_HOST to THIS node's LAN/WireGuard IP
                          # do not use localhost — host networking bypasses loopback

make aggregator           # starts aggregator + collector (self-monitoring)
```

### k3s / Kubernetes cluster

A cluster is ingested by the aggregator as a pull target, not by a collector.

```bash
make kube                 # on the cluster: bootstrap kube-state-metrics (idempotent)
```

`make kube` installs kube-state-metrics via Helm, exposes it on a NodePort, and
reports the `<host-ip>:<nodeport>`. The aggregator's target file points at it:

```yaml
# aggregator/targets/kube-state-metrics.yml
- targets: ["<host-ip>:<ksm-nodeport>"]
  labels: { cluster: <cluster-name> }
```

The `kube-state-metrics-pull` job scrapes it and theseus `aggrokube` builds the
cluster dashboard. Target files are provisioned per-aggregator by Ansible; an
aggregator with no such file scrapes no cluster.
See `aggregator/targets/kube-state-metrics.yml.example`.

### Grafana

Navigate to `http://<aggregator-ip>:3000`.
Default credentials: `admin` / `admin`
Grafana prompts for a new password on first login.

Prometheus and Loki are pre-provisioned as data sources.

## Make targets

```
make collector          deploy collector stack on this node
make aggregator         deploy aggregator + collector stacks (aggregator node)
make kube               bootstrap kube-state-metrics on this k3s/k8s cluster (idempotent)
make check-env          warn about required keys missing from .env files
make restart            restart all running obs stacks on this node
make restart-collector  restart collector stack only
make restart-aggregator restart aggregator stack only
make down               tear down all running obs stacks on this node
make status             show status of all obs stacks
make help               show available targets
```

## Configuration

### collector/.env

| Variable             | Required | Default         | Description                                        |
|----------------------|----------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| AGGREGATOR_HOST      | ✓        | —               | IP or hostname of the aggregator node              |
| NODE_NAME            |          | system hostname | Label applied to all metrics and logs              |
| NODE_EXPORTER_PORT   |          | 9100            | Override if port is taken on this host             |
| AGGREGATOR_PROM_PORT |          | 9090            | Must match aggregator's Prometheus port            |
| AGGREGATOR_LOKI_PORT |          | 3100            | Must match aggregator's Loki port                  |

Kubernetes is not configured here — see the k3s section above. Cluster scrape
targets (and the `cluster` label) live in the aggregator's
`targets/kube-state-metrics.yml`, not in any collector `.env`.

### aggregator/.env

| Variable             | Required | Default | Description                              |
|----------------------|----------|---------|------------------------------------------|
| AGGREGATOR_PROM_PORT |          | 9090    | Prometheus port exposed on this host     |
| AGGREGATOR_LOKI_PORT |          | 3100    | Loki port exposed on this host           |
| GRAFANA_PORT         |          | 3000    | Grafana port exposed on this host        |
| PROM_RETENTION       |          | 90d     | Prometheus data retention period         |
| LOKI_RETENTION       |          | 744h    | Loki data retention period (31 days)     |

## Notes

- `.env` files are gitignored — they contain node-specific addressing.
  Always copy from `.env.example` and fill in locally.
- The aggregator node runs both stacks. `make aggregator` handles this by
  calling `make collector` after the aggregator stack is up.
- `make kube` is idempotent — re-running it skips completed steps and
  reprints the KSM NodePort for the aggregator's target file.
- Adding a new node to the fleet: copy the `collector/` directory,
  set `AGGREGATOR_HOST`, run `make collector`. That's it.
- For a k3s cluster: run `make kube` on the cluster, then add its
  `targets/kube-state-metrics.yml` on the aggregator that owns it.
- Tested on: Raspbian Trixie, Arch Linux, Ubuntu. Any Linux with Docker works.
